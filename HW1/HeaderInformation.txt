Review the HTTP Headers in the Request and Response 
â€“ create text file and describe each key value pair
 in the HTTP header in both request and response and
 check it in with the project to GitHub (e.g. what is
 the content-type and what does it mean?)

 Alt-Svc ?hq=":443"; ma=2592000; quic=51303431; quic=51303339; quic=51303338; quic=51303337; quic=51303335,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="41,39,38,37,35"
meaning alternative service, where else the request can be found.

Cache-Control ?private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
meaning cache rules. Private connection, since max-age is 0 the request (no matter what) must 
receive the request from the server.

Content-Encoding ?gzip
meaning the http can be in a gzip 

Content-Type ?application/json; charset=UTF-8
meaning Base64-encoded binary MD5 sum of the content of the request body

the time and date the message was originated

ETag ?"f6QLsd8inUgRKJVNBqJ8xHnPb0w/qf7Fg2SYRIoio4sScrD5jq-Aiso"

Transfer-Encoding ?chunked

Vary ?Origin
determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached
response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server. 

Vary ?X-Origin
determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached
response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server. 

X-Content-Type-Options ?nosniff
prevents mime based attacks. The nosniff option: the server says the content is text/html, 
the browser will render it as text/html.

X-XSS-Protection ?1; mode=block
response header of IE, Chrome, and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected XSS attacks.
